As a team of six we designed an app to tackle networking problems amongst our fellow bootcampers (events had to be posted several times, and still not everyone was informed). We had one week to research and create our MVP. We used a tech stack of Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Our future plans are to implement the login feature (pictured above).
