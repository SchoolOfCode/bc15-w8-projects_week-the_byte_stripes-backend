This app was designed and coded by Tom Platt, Melissa Thornley, Marco Ronchi, Jack Yelland, Sara Thampi and Charlotte Rogers.

## Inspiration
We noticed our fellow bootcampers were having networking problems: events had to be posted several times on our slack channel, and still not everyone was informed. Event organisers had to make multiple regular posts. We wanted to do something to help.\
From our user research we discovered that bootcampers are often nervous of attending tech events if they don't know anyone else who is going. We decided we were also going to tackle this problem.

## Solution
Our solution was to design a networking app. Bootcampers can easily see all upcoming events and filter them by event type. \
They can also easily see if someone else is attending, and make their decision to attend based on this.

## Tech Stack
We used a tech stack of Node.js, Express.js, PostGreSQL, SQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We used Playwright and Vitest for testing.

## Process
We had one week to research and create our MVP. Two days for research, two days for coding and one day to prepare and give our presentations and to carry out testing. We split into a frontend and backend team initially and then worked together to integrate the frontend and backend. We changed the colour of the attend buttons (orginally black) due to user feedback stating that it was hard to see. We also conducted daily standups and retros.

## Challenges
- Connecting the front and back end
- Mapping the attend buttons when the results were filtered.

## What We Learned
Clean, elegant design. \
Mapping the attend buttons depending on the amount of events.

## Future Plans

- Password hashing
- Add Events
- List of Attendees
- Attendee Chat
- Filter by location
- Map of location
